Tabula Rasa is a lightweight “bugfix + tools” Wabbajack modlist that gives Skyrim SE/AE a clean, stable, and modernized foundation for building your own load order—no visuals, no gameplay changes, just a rock-solid base with Community Shaders and essential fixes preconfigured.

Overview
Tabula Rasa is built for players and mod authors who want a conflict-free starting point focused on engine stability, scripting reliability, and modern shader support rather than content or balance changes. Inspired by Biggie_boss’s Baseline, it updates the concept with current tools, curated patchers, and a fully integrated Community Shaders setup so you can 
Immediately begin layering your own mods on top.

Features
Pure “blank slate” setup: no new quests, textures, models, combat tweaks, or perk overhauls—only technical fixes and tools.

Modern engine and script stack, including stability enhancements, bugfix rolls, load-order foundations, and shader compatibility tuned for heavy modding.

Fully configured Community Shaders with support for updated lighting, rendering, and shadows out of the box.

Wabbajack-powered, reproducible install designed to eliminate common pitfalls like broken paths, bad permissions, and mismatched executable versions.

Requirements
Skyrim Special Edition or Anniversary Edition updated to version 1.6.1170, set to English.

Visual C++ x64 and .NET Desktop Runtime v5 are installed for bundled tools and patchers.

Skyrim, Steam, Wabbajack, and the modlist are installed outside Program Files, OneDrive, Desktop, and Documents to avoid permission and sync issues.

Creation Club content is fully downloaded by launching Skyrim once to the main menu, without verifying files or alt-tabbing during downloads.

Installation (Wabbajack)
Create three folders such as C:\Modding\Wabbajack\, C:\Modding\TabulaRasa\, and C:\Modding\Downloads\, all outside protected or cloud-synced locations.

Download the latest Wabbajack release from the official site and place it in your Wabbajack folder.

Run Wabbajack, choose “Install a Modlist,” and select or import the Tabula Rasa list.

Set the installation folder to your Tabula Rasa directory and the downloads folder accordingly, then start the install.

Let Wabbajack complete without heavy multitasking; if there are failed downloads, use Retry and verify paths, antivirus, and folder locations.

After installation, launch ModOrganizer.exe from the Tabula Rasa folder, select the Tabula Rasa profile, and start the game via SKSE inside MO2—never from Steam.

Post‑Install and Support
Backing up the finished Tabula Rasa installation and exporting your MO2 profile is strongly recommended before you begin layering your own mods. Keep Steam auto-updates disabled and avoid verifying game files unless specifically instructed, to preserve compatibility. For updates, troubleshooting, and access to other Nymph Nerds projects, join the Nymph Crew Discord listed on the Nexus Mods page.
